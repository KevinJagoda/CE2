Testbench of the decoder structural:

Testbench of the decoder behaviorial:

Both Testbench simulators are identical and correct.

The image of my simulations and the example simulation are different due to the difference in the order I placed the 
  inputs. However, after checking them individually, all values resulted in the same answers and the 
  simulation is correct.



15. We created a decoder, who has the purpose of taking encoded data and traslating it into a word, message, or code.
  They are important for applications like multiplexing and memory decoding, reducing the size of the required
  amount of memory needed.
